### Django REST framework QuickStart 

the quick start example of the official site can't work, so I modify it.


access apt:

curl -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -u admin:password123 http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/

curl -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -u admin:password123 http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1/

through the browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/
